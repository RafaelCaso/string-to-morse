# string-to-morse
encode English into morse code text and mp3 file

This app uses flask webframework, Flask SQLAlchemy, Python and templates provided by HTML5 Up for JS, CSS and HTML.

It is still unable to automatically load mp3 file without first navigating into the register or login pages. This then erases the text so currently unable to view
text while listening to mp3 file simultaneously.

db created with intention of allowing users to login and see past encodings/mp3 files. Plan to build 'learn to use morse code' functionality in future.
the idea is to show user several cards with the morse translation in text underneath then play the morse code for single character and prompt user to select which
character they heard. Different levels will increase in difficulty.

Plan to crete functionality for user to use space bar as encoder and to render in English what they tap out on encoder
